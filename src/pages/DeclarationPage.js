        <h4>一  聖經</h4>
        <p>
          聖經是由神感動卻由人寫成。神藉聖經向人啟示祂自己，它是神教導完全的寶庫。 神是聖經的作者，救恩是聖經的終極真理，聖經內容完全无误。因此，所有 經文是完全真實可靠的。它啟示神審判人的原則，因此它將存到世界的末了。聖經 是基督徒合一真正的中心，它是所有人的行為，信條，宗教觀的最崇高標準 。所有經文是見證基督，祂是自有永有，神啟示的焦點。<br/>
          <b>(1) Bible</b>: The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God’s revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God judges us, and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions should be tried. All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine revelation.

        <h4>二  神</h4>
        <p>
          只有一位永活的真神，祂是一位智慧，屬靈和永存的個體，造物主，救贖主，維護者，和宇宙的統治者。神是無限聖潔，和無限的完全。祂是全能，全知；祂的全知超越一切的事物，過去，現在，和將來，包括祂所创造的拥有自由意志的人在未来做出的決定，我们欠祂最崇高的愛，尊敬，與順服。永恆的三一神以父，子，聖靈啟示祂自己，以不同位格顯現 ，卻在本性，本質，和自存上并无分别的。<br/>
          <b>(2) GOD</b>: There is one and only one living and true God. He is an intelligent, spiritual, and personal Being, the Creator, Redeemer, Preserver, and Ruler of the universe. God is infinite in holiness and all other perfections. God is all powerful and all knowing; and His perfect knowledge extends to all things, past, present, and future, including the future decisions of His free creatures. To Him we owe the highest love, reverence, and obedience. The eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.<br/>
          <b>A. 父神</b><br/>
          父神按着恩典的目的管轄祂的宇宙，他所造的万物，并领导人類歷史的发展。祂是全能，全知，全愛，和全智的。对於那些因信耶穌基督而成為神兒女的人，祂是他们的父。祂對一切受造的人顯出祂的父性。<br/>
          <b>A. God the Father:</b> God as Father reigns with providential care over His universe, His creatures, and the flow of the stream of human history according to the purposes of His grace. He is all powerful, all knowing, all loving, and all wise. God is Father in truth to those who become children of God through faith in Jesus Christ. He is fatherly in His attitude toward all men.<br/>
          <b>B. 神子</b><br/>
          基督是永恆的神子。耶穌基督道成肉身，祂藉著聖靈懷孕，從童女馬利亞而生 。耶穌完全啟示並遵行神的旨意，祂取了人的樣式，完全承受了人的要求和需要，他将自己和人完全等同只是祂沒有犯罪。祂尊重神的律法，順從祂的話，替代人釘死在十字架上，為将人類从罪中拯救出来。祂以榮耀的身體從死裏復活，向祂的門徒顯現，正如祂未釘十字架前與他們同在一樣 。祂升上高天，現在被高舉坐在神的右邊。祂是唯一的中保，完全 的神，完全的人，藉著祂人得與神和好。祂將會以能力和榮耀再來，審判世人，完成祂救贖的使命。祂現在住在一切信徒心中，是永活和永在的主。<br/>
          <b>B. God the Son:</b> Christ is the eternal Son of God. In His incarnation as Jesus Christ He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. Jesus perfectly revealed and did the will of God, taking upon Himself human nature with its demands and necessities and identifying Himself completely with mankind yet without sin. He honored the divine law by His personal obedience, and in His substitutionary death on the cross He made provision for the redemption of men from sin. He was raised from the dead with a glorified body and appeared to His disciples as the person who was with them before His crucifixion. He ascended into heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God where He is the One Mediator, fully God, fully man, in whose Person is effected the reconciliation between God and man. He will return in power and glory to judge the world and to consummate His redemptive mission. He now dwells in all believers as the living and ever present Lord.<br/>
          <b>C. 聖灵</b><br/>
          聖靈是神的靈，完全的神。祂感動聖人寫成聖經，祂藉著光照使人明白真理。祂高舉基督，使人為罪，為義，為審判自責。祂呼召人歸向救主，使人重生。 在重生的時候，祂為每位信徒施浸歸入基督。祂孕育基督徒的品格，安慰他們，將屬靈恩賜賞給他們，使他們藉著教會服事神。祂給每位信徒印記以待最後救贖的日 子。祂住在信徒里面是神将信徒带入完全像基督的保障。祂在敬拜，傳道，與服事中光照並加力給信徒和教會。<br/>
          <b>C. God the Holy Spirit:</b> The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, fully divine. He inspired holy men of old to write the Scriptures. Through illumination He enables men to understand truth. He exalts Christ. He convicts men of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. He calls men to the Saviour, and effects regeneration. At the moment of regeneration He baptizes every believer into the Body of Christ. He cultivates Christian character, comforts believers, and bestows the spiritual gifts by which they serve God through His church. He seals the believer unto the day of final redemption. His presence in the Christian is the guarantee that God will bring the believer into the fullness of the stature of Christ. He enlightens and empowers the believer and the church in worship, evangelism, and service.

        <h4>三   人</h4>
        <p>
          人是按照神的形像特別的創造。神造男造女，人是神創造萬物中的傑作。性别是神良善創 造中一份禮物。人起初是無罪的，造物主賜給他們自由意志，人藉著自由抉擇 犯罪得罪神，罪因此進入人類中。由於撒但的試探，人違背神的命令，他們從起初 的良善中墮落了，为此人的后代堕继承一個傾向犯罪的人性和環境。因此，當他們有道德行為能力的時 候，他們就犯罪，落在審判之中。只有神的恩惠能恢復他們與神聖潔的關係，使人能 履行神創造的目的。人有圣洁的品格是神用他的形象造人和基督為 人而死的明证；因此，每一個種族每一個人都享有完全的尊嚴，值得尊敬和基督徒的 愛。<br/>
          <b>(3) Man:</b> Man is the special creation of God, made in His own image. He created them male and female as the crowning work of His creation. The gift of gender is thus part of the goodness of God’s creation. In the beginning man was innocent of sin and was endowed by his Creator with freedom of choice. By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race. Through the temptation of Satan man transgressed the command of God, and fell from his original innocence whereby his posterity inherit a nature and an environment inclined toward sin. Therefore, as soon as they are capable of moral action, they become transgressors and are under condemnation. Only the grace of God can bring man into His holy fellowship and enable man to fulfill the creative purpose of God. The sacredness of human personality is evident in that God created man in His own image, and in that Christ died for man; therefore, every person of every race possesses full dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love.

        <h4>四   救恩</h4>
        <p>
          救恩包括全人的救贖，凡接受耶穌為救主為主的人，都可以得救。基督藉著祂的寶 血使信的人蒙受永恆的救贖。從廣義言，救恩包括了重生，稱義，成聖，和得榮耀。 人不相信耶穌基督為主，無从獲得救恩。<br/>
          <b>(4) Salvation:</b> Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer. In its broadest sense salvation includes regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification. There is no salvation apart from personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord.<br/>
          <b>A. 重生，或新生</b>，是神恩惠的工作，藉此信徒在耶穌基督裏成為新造的 人。這是通过認罪，聖靈在人心作改變的工作，意即罪人向神悔改，並信 靠主耶穌基督。悔改與信心是個人經歷救恩不可分的經驗。 悔改是人真正轉離罪歸向神，信心是接受耶穌基督為救主為主，全人委身給祂。<br/>
          <b>A. Regeneration, or the new birth,</b> is a work of God’s grace whereby believers become new creatures in Christ Jesus. It is a change of heart wrought by the Holy Spirit through conviction of sin, to which the sinner responds in repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Repentance and faith are inseparable experiences of grace. Repentance is a genuine turning from sin toward God. Faith is the acceptance of Jesus Christ and commitment of the entire personality to Him as Lord and Saviour.<br/>
          <b>B. 稱義</b>是神的恩典，充滿了赦罪的原則，就是祂的義赦免一切悔改並相 信基督的罪人。稱義使信徒進入與神和好的關係，蒙神的恩寵。<br/>
          <b>B. Justification</b> is God’s gracious and full acquittal upon principles of His righteousness of all sinners who repent and believe in Christ. Justification brings the believer unto a relationship of peace and favor with God.<br/>
          <b>C. 成聖</b>是种經歷，始于重生，藉此信徒為了神的目的分別為聖，並且藉著聖 靈入住的大能和同在，使信徒的品德和靈性進入更成熟的地步，重生的 人因在神的恩典中繼續不斷地成長。<br/>
          <b>C. Sanctification</b> is the experience, beginning in regeneration, by which the believer is set apart to God’s purposes, and is enabled to progress toward moral and spiritual maturity through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in him. Growth in grace should continue throughout the regenerate person’s life.<br/>
          <b>D. 得榮耀</b>是救贖的頂峰，最後的祝福，蒙恩得救之人的终点。<br/>
          <b>D. Glorification</b> is the culmination of salvation and is the final blessed and abiding state of the redeemed.

        <h4>五   神恩惠的目的</h4>
        <p>
          揀選是神恩惠的目的，神藉此使罪人重生，稱義，成聖，和得榮耀。它和人自由的抉择相一致，明白神一切的方法與終極有關。它是神主權榮耀的彰顯，显示神是無限智慧的，聖潔的，和不能改變的。它除去人的驕傲，并要求人謙卑。<br/>
          所有真正的信徒必忍耐到底，神在基督裏接納並藉祂的靈成聖的人，永不會從恩典 中墜落的，但要存留到永遠。信徒可能因為疏忽、受試探而犯罪，使聖靈擔憂，損 害了他們的恩惠與平安，使他們因基督的缘故受責罰和神暂时的管教，但他們仍然得著神能力的保 守，藉著信心而得的救恩。<br/>
          <b>(5) God’s Purpose of Grace:</b> Election is the gracious purpose of God, according to which He regenerates, justifies, sanctifies, and glorifies sinners. It is consistent with the free agency of man, and comprehends all the means in connection with the end. It is the glorious display of God’s sovereign goodness, and is infinitely wise, holy, and unchangeable. It excludes boasting and promotes humility.<br/>
          All true believers endure to the end. Those whom God has accepted in Christ, and sanctified by His Spirit, will never fall away from the state of grace, but shall persevere to the end. Believers may fall into sin through neglect and temptation, whereby they grieve the Spirit, impair their graces and comforts, and bring reproach on the cause of Christ and temporal judgments on themselves; yet they shall be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.

        <h4>六   教會</h4>
        <p>
          主耶穌基督的新約教會是一個由受浸信徒組成本地自主的會眾，藉着信約和福音的团契彼此聯繫，遵守基督设立的兩個圣儀，用神的律法的治理，藉著祂的話，行使聖 靈賦與的恩賜與特權，尋求擴展福音直到地極。每個教会在基督的主權和民主的進 程下行事，如此的教会每位會友負有对基督的責任与义务，並尊基督為主。圣经所设立的职位是牧師和 執事.。虽然在教会中，男女都有服侍的恩赐，按聖經的教訓，符合资格的牧師仅限于男性。<br/>
          新約教會也是基督的身體，包括所有在各時代得贖来自不同种族，不同语言和不同国家的信徒。<br/>
          <b>(6) The Church:</b> A New Testament church of the Lord Jesus Christ is an autonomous local congregation of baptized believers, associated by covenant in the faith and fellowship of the gospel; observing the two ordinances of Christ, governed by His laws, exercising the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by His Word, and seeking to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth. Each congregation operates under the Lordship of Christ through democratic processes. In such a congregation each member is responsible and accountable to Christ as Lord. Its scriptural officers are pastors and deacons. While both men and women are gifted for service in the church, the office of pastor is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.<br/>
          The New Testament speaks also of the church as the Body of Christ which includes all of the redeemed of all the ages, believers from every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation.

        <h4>七   浸禮与主餐</h4>
        <p>
          基督徒的洗禮是奉聖父，聖子，聖靈的名為信徒全身浸入水中。這是順服的行動， 象徵信徒的信仰，與主同釘死，同埋葬，和同復活，浸入水中指信徒向罪而死，將舊人埋葬，復活是在基督裏的新生命與主同行。它是相信耶稣死后復活的见证。作 為教會的圣儀，它是教會會友的資格和守主餐的先決條件。<br/>
          主餐是象徵順服的行動，會友藉此一同領受主的餅和主的杯，紀念救贖主受死和期待祂的再來。<br/>
          <b>(7) Baptism and the Lord’s Supper:</b> Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer’s faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer’s death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to his faith in the final resurrection of the dead. Being a church ordinance, it is prerequisite to the privileges of church membership and to the Lord’s Supper.<br/>
          The Lord’s Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members of the church, through partaking of the bread and the fruit of the vine, memorialize the death of the Redeemer and anticipate His second coming.

          <b>(8) The Lord’s Day:</b> The first day of the week is the Lord’s Day. It is a Christian institution for regular observance. It commemorates the resurrection of Christ from the dead and should include exercises of worship and spiritual devotion, both public and private. Activities on the Lord’s Day should be commensurate with the Christian’s conscience under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

          神國包括兩方面：神對宇宙的主權，和在那些甘願承認祂為王的人心中掌 王權。神國是救恩的領域，只有那些因信和像孩子一样委身給耶穌基督的人才可以進入 的。基督徒必須禱告和努力事奉主，使神的國早日降臨，祂的旨意能行在地 上。神國完全实现要等到主耶穌基督再來和這時代的结束。<br/>
          <b>(9) The Kingdom:</b> The Kingdom of God includes both His general sovereignty over the universe and His particular kingship over men who willfully acknowledge Him as King. Particularly the Kingdom is the realm of salvation into which men enter by trustful, childlike commitment to Jesus Christ. Christians ought to pray and to labor that the Kingdom may come and God’s will be done on earth. The full consummation of the Kingdom awaits the return of Jesus Christ and the end of this age.

          神有自己的時間，並用祂自己的方法，使這世界有完滿的結束。按照祂的應許，耶穌基督會親自再來，在榮耀中顯現，地上的人都可以看見祂；死人要復活；基督要 按公義審判一切的人。不義的人將會被放逐到地獄裏，就是那永遠受刑的地方。義人要在復活和榮耀的身體中，蒙神賞賜，永遠在天堂與主同在。<br/>
          <b>(10) Last Things:</b> God, in His own time and in His own way, will bring the world to its  end. According to His promise, Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth; the dead will be raised; and Christ will judge all men in righteousness. The unrighteous will be consigned to Hell, the place of everlasting punishment. The righteous in their resurrected and glorified bodies will receive their reward and will dwell forever in Heaven with the Lord.

        <p>
          竭力使万作主门徒是每個基督跟從者和每個耶穌基督教會的責任與特權。新人的靈是聖靈的工作 使我們去愛別人。因此，对世人宣教的努力是源自于人的靈重生的需要，以及在基督的教导中不斷重复的命令。主耶穌基督囑咐我們將福音傳給萬民聽，這是每個屬神兒女的責任，不 斷尋求通过口里的见证和基督徒生活方式为基督赢得失散的人，及用其他符合基督福音的方法傳道。<br/>
          <b>(11) Evangelism and Missions:</b> It is the duty and privilege of every follower of Christ and of every church of the Lord Jesus Christ to endeavor to make disciples of all nations. The new birth of man’s spirit by God’s Holy Spirit means the birth of love for others. Missionary effort on the part of all rests thus upon a spiritual necessity of the regenerate life, and is expressly and repeatedly commanded in the teachings of Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ has commanded the preaching of the gospel to all nations. It is the duty of every child of God to seek constantly to win the lost to Christ by verbal witness undergirded by a Christian lifestyle, and by other methods in harmony with the gospel of Christ.

        <p>
          神是一切暫時和屬靈賜福的泉源；我們和我們所擁有的一切都是屬祂的。基督徒作为神福音的使者，应当用他們的時間，才幹，和擁有的物質事奉神；並且認識這受托的一切為了 榮耀祂和幫助其他的人。按照聖經，為了促進救主在地上的國度，基督徒應該 快樂地，經常地，有系統性，按比例，慷慨地貢獻他們的一切 。<br/>
          <b>(12) Stewardship:</b> God is the source of all blessings, temporal and spiritual; all that we have and are we owe to Him. Christians as ambassadors of the Gospel are thus obligated to serve Him with their time, talents, and material possessions for the glory of God and for helping others. According to the Scriptures, Christians should contribute of their means cheerfully, regularly, systematically, proportionately, and liberally for the advancement of the Redeemer’s cause on earth.

        <h4>十三   家庭</h4>
        <p>
          神設立家庭，使之成為人類社會基礎的組織。家庭成員藉婚姻血源和領養互為關係 。<br/>
          <b>(13)The Family:</b> God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human society. It is composed of persons related to one another by marriage, blood, or adoption.<br/>
          婚姻是一男一女結合，終身委身在盟約上。家庭是神獨一的禮物，啟示基督與教會 的聯合，提供男女在婚姻上親密伴侶的架構。按照聖經的標準婚姻是性关系的渠道，和繁衍人類種族的 方法。<br/>
          Marriage is the uniting of one man and one woman in covenant commitment for a lifetime. It is God’s unique gift to reveal the union between Christ and His church and to provide for the man and the woman in marriage the framework for intimate companionship, the channel of sexual expression according to biblical standards, and the means for procreation of the human race.<br/>
          丈夫與妻子在神面前是平等，因為他們是按照神的形像造成。婚姻的關係反应神與其 子民的關係，丈夫要愛他的妻子，正如基督愛教會。他具有神所賜的責任，供 給，保獲和領導他的家庭。妻子愿意順服在丈夫仆人式的領導下，正如教會甘 願順服基督的領導。她具有神的形像如丈夫一樣，因此與丈夫同等，具有神所賜的 責任尊敬她的丈夫，作他的帮助者服事、管理自己的家，並培育下一代。<br/>
          The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God’s image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to His people. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation.<br/>
          儿女從母腹受孕的那一刻起，是主的祝福和產業。父母在婚姻上因作儿女的榜样。 父母要教導兒女屬靈和道德觀，藉著不变的生活方式给他们作榜樣，愛的管教，基於聖經真 理作決，引導他們的兒女。兒女要尊敬和順服他們的父母。<br/>
          Children, from the moment of conception, are a blessing and heritage from the Lord. Parents are to demonstrate to their children God’s pattern for marriage. Parents are to teach their children spiritual and moral values and to lead them, through consistent lifestyle example and loving discipline, to make choices based on biblical truth. Children are to honor and obey their parents.
